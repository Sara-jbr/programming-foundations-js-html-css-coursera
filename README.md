# Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS – Practice Projects

This repository contains my personal practice projects from the [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web) **"Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS"** by Duke University.

##  About the Course

This course is designed for beginners who want to learn the core building blocks of web development and programming. It introduces:

- The **fundamentals of programming** using JavaScript
- Basic **web development with HTML and CSS**
- Programming logic like **variables, functions, loops, and conditionals**
- Working with **images, user input, and canvas** to create interactive web pages

##  What is "Foundation Programming"?

"Foundation programming" means learning the basic concepts that are essential to all programming languages. This includes:
- Writing simple instructions (code)
- Understanding how computers follow logic
- Building blocks like **if-statements**, **loops**, and **functions**
- Problem-solving using code

This course teaches these concepts using **JavaScript**, which runs in every modern browser and is a core web language.

##  Technologies Used

- **HTML** – To structure web content
- **CSS** – To style the content
- **JavaScript** – To add logic and interactivity
- **Canvas API** – For drawing graphics in the browser
- **SimpleImage.js** – A library used in the course to manipulate and display images

##  Exercises I Practiced

Here are some of the projects I built to practice the concepts:

###  Paint Canvas
- A drawing application using the HTML5 Canvas
- Lets users choose brush color and size
- Tracks mouse movements to paint

###  Image Upload and Display
- Allows users to upload an image
- Uses `SimpleImage.js` to display it on a canvas

###  Convert Image to Grayscale
- Loads and displays an image
- Converts the image to grayscale by averaging RGB values of each pixel
